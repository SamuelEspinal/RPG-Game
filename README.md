# RPG Pixel Game

### 🎮 A Passion Project Fully Built in Java

This RPG Pixel Game is a labor of love inspired by my lifelong passion for video games. Growing up, video games have been an essential part of my life, sparking creativity and fueling my curiosity about how they work. This project is my attempt to create a game from the ground up, and I handled every aspect of its development—from the code and art to the music.
